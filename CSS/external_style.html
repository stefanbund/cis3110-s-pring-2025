    <div class="box-nature">

    </div>

    <div class="box-dark">
        <p>This is the modern dark box. Its styles are safely tucked away in the CSS file.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="box-playful">
        <p>This is the playful box! Separating files makes it easier to manage large projects.</p>
